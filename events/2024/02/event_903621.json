The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt21235248/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the 3-day opening weekend (March 22 - March 24) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if 'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' (2024) grosses between $45,000,000 (inclusive) and $50,000,000 (inclusive) on its 3-day opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo numbers under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend (which typically includes Thursday's previews), regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 28, 2024, 11:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n\n","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-03-22T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-03-22","featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"$45m-50m ","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-ghostbusters-frozen-empire-gross-between-45m-50m-opening-weekend-576b36d5-389e-42ed-93c8-662081b25b65.png","id":"255001","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-ghostbusters-frozen-empire-gross-between-45m-50m-opening-weekend-576b36d5-389e-42ed-93c8-662081b25b65.png","lastTradePrice":0,"makerBaseFee":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","marketType":"normal","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x904aa321a48f737e2223e7b3007bf51d68b6a0d66bdda0c1e4bc581f55d62800","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x5e835825a001bda38ac905478e2b39eadbca0a2bf2b75ebae7b5175554fdc3ff","new":false,"notificationsEnabled":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will 'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' gross between $45m-50m opening weekend?
