Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAn anomaly within the stated range for 2024 will be sufficient to resolve this market to \"Yes\" immediately once the data becomes available regardless of whether the figure for 2024 is later revised.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the figure found in the table titled \"Land-Ocean Temperature Index (C)\" under the column \"No_Smoothing\" in the row \"2024\" (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/graph_data/Global_Mean_Estimates_based_on_Land_and_Ocean_Data/graph.txt). If NASA's \"Global Temperature Index\" is rendered permanently unavailable, other information from NASA may be used. If no information for 2024 is provided by NASA by March 1, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve \"No\".","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-31T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-12-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"3","groupItemTitle":"1.28-1.30","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hot+earth.png","id":"506020","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hot+earth.png","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xfdf633bc34e7f822a9bc3cfcf881bab26beb82bbe3a45aa3de7dc29e9eb28e00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xce0ef4b1c9831978542345d4a0d3274c311cdfed17d5d87c972fe61614fb4d58","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.0085,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Global heat increase between 1.28°C and 1.30°C for 2024?","questionID":"0xfdf633bc34e7f822a9bc3cfcf881bab26beb82bbe3a45aa3de7dc29e9eb28e03","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":50,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"global-heat-increase-between-1pt28c-and-1pt30c-for-2024","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-08-28T20:32:58.247Z","startDateIso":"2024-08-28","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2025-01-10T19:32:10Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2025-01-11T17:20:39.43241Z","volume":"480839.240367","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":480839.240367,"volumeNum":480839.240367}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xfdf633bc34e7f822a9bc3cfcf881bab26beb82bbe3a45aa3de7dc29e9eb28e00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"global-heat-increase-2024","startDate":"2024-08-28T20:33:11.031052Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-01-03T17:38:30.099Z","forceShow":false,"id":"832","label":"Global Temp","publishedAt":"2024-01-03 17:38:30.089+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-temp","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:38:56.040231Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:16:20.826Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"74","label":"Science","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:16:20.623+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"science","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:21:32.707323Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"global-heat-increase-2024","title":"Global Heat Increase 2024","updatedAt":"2025-01-11T19:28:50.935567Z","volume":14469571.41811825,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
