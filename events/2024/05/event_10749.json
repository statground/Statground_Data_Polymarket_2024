Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than 0.1 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from April to May 2024 and “No“ otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS May 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.2%, the market will resolve to “Yes”, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to “No”).","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-06-12T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-06-12","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","id":"501790","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"US inflation >0.1% from April to May 2024?","questionID":"0xa8e0348a46dee2e6eabfae5ced98c7bcc76d5bb57cc9af8991782e2b27c0cd00","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"us-inflation-0pt1-from-april-to-may-2024","spread":0.01,"submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-06-12T14:32:59Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-06-13T12:26:18.423946Z","volume":"27663.010849","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":27663.010849,"volumeNum":27663.01}],"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"us-inflation-0pt1-from-april-to-may-2024","startDate":"2024-05-23T15:34:22.312744Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-12-11T19:05:53.105Z","forceShow":false,"id":"702","label":"Inflation","publishedAt":"2023-12-11 19:05:53.075+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"inflation","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:24:38.514477Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-12T17:15:26.94Z","id":"1309","label":"us inflation","publishedAt":"2024-02-12 17:15:26.934+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"us-inflation","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:25:43.363499Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-12-04T17:23:56.457Z","id":"619","label":"financial forecast","publishedAt":"2023-12-04 17:23:56.421+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"financial-forecast","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:24:15.474641Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:19:11.002019Z"}],"ticker":"us-inflation-0pt1-from-april-to-may-2024","title":"US inflation >0.1% from April to May 2024?","updatedAt":"2024-06-13T12:26:22.432385Z","volume":27663.010849,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
