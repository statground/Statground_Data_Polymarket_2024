Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Nevada for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once Nevada has certified the vote. \n\nIf a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-11-05","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"8","groupItemTitle":"Harris by 3.0-4.0%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/swing+nevada.png","id":"509218","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nevada-margin-of-victory-Vvjs5WDdU3_X.jpg","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xc71d77290d88ebb53f5bdc5de95563453306dc5429203f8765f7323619a15400","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xde3343d7f4289a497814ed78792db1b19faa9049263d435babab59d49586da9d","new":false,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the Democratic candidate win Nevada by 3.0%-4.0%?
