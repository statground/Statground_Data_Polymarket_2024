Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nCompound words will count as long as \"Ukraine\" is part of the compound word and references the meaning which refers to the eastern European country.\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" if the interview has finished airing in its entirety and the Yes condition wasn't met. If the interview has not aired in its entirety by December 6, 2024, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve based on what has aired up to that point. If no interview is aired by this time, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source is the video of the interview.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-04T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-12-04","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"14","groupItemTitle":"Ukraine","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-hegseth-saying-during-fox-interview-ZAxx2FycDViU.jpg","id":"514657","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-hegseth-saying-during-fox-interview-ZAxx2FycDViU.jpg","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.1695,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Hegseth say \"Ukraine\" during the interview?","questionID":"0xb003595a3246253cee083b4786ee4900bbfd9dcc931be3ab7bdfbd9ccaeaad11","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-hegseth-say-ukraine-during-the-interview","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-12-04T00:56:48.420049Z","startDateIso":"2024-12-04","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-12-07T07:20:38Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-12-08T06:57:16.212931Z","volume":"11440.476254","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":11440.476254,"volumeNum":11440.476254}],"negRisk":false,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"what-will-hegseth-saying-during-fox-interview","startDate":"2024-12-04T00:57:19.88597Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-12-04T03:30:21.546255Z","id":"101419","label":"Pete Hegseth","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"pete-hegseth","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:55:31.76653Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-16T02:29:11.548984Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100343","label":"Mentions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"mention-markets","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:25:25.091604Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-11-06T19:11:23.726727Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101193","label":"Cabinet","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump-cabinet","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:06:09.749807Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:23:16.39Z","forceShow":false,"id":"126","label":"Trump","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:23:16.384+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"trump","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:52:06.992969Z","updatedBy":15}],"ticker":"what-will-hegseth-saying-during-fox-interview","title":"What will Hegseth say during Fox interview?","updatedAt":"2024-12-08T06:57:28.136561Z","volume":329413.068676,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
