The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the there are 8 or more cuts of 25 basis points by the Fed's December meeting (including any cuts made during Dec meeting). Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No.”\n\nFor example, if the FED cuts rates by 50 bps after a meeting, it would be considered 2 cuts (of 25 bps each).\n\nNote that cuts between 1-24 bps (inclusive) will also be considered 1 rate cut.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be FOMC statements after meetings scheduled in 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. The level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2025-12-10T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2025-12-10","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"8","groupItemTitle":"8 or more (200+ bps)","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025-9qstZkSL1dn0.jpg","id":"516729","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025-9qstZkSL1dn0.jpg","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xc0f1a3e1cf79a9eaa1b2f4a6ccb3fc77549b736876dd82aadda2e1c483493a6e","new":false,"oneMonthPriceChange":-0.001,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will 8+ Fed rate cuts happen in 2025?","questionID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be08","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-8plus-fed-rate-cuts-happen-in-2025","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-12-29T22:49:51.6373Z","startDateIso":"2024-12-29","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2025-12-10T22:17:52Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[\"proposed\", \"resolved\"]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T00:34:00.534494Z","volume":"3970078.575117","volume1mo":1660188.584335,"volume1moClob":1660188.584335,"volume1wk":1549924.42,"volume1wkClob":1549924.42,"volume1yr":3970078.575117001,"volume1yrClob":3970078.575117001,"volumeClob":3970078.575117,"volumeNum":3970078.575117}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025","startDate":"2024-12-29T22:50:43.348587Z","tags":[{"forceShow":true,"id":"100196","label":"Fed Rates","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"fed-rates","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:37:37.235297Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:20:37.488Z","forceShow":false,"id":"107","label":"Business","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:20:37.48+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"business","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:39:36.851119Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-12-30T20:11:13.144816Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101588","label":"2025 Predictions","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"2025-predictions","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:04:44.902584Z"},{"createdAt":"2025-02-06T18:05:50.554703Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101800","label":"Economic Policy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economic-policy","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:08:08.984313Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-12-18T23:06:40.410115Z","id":"101550","label":"Jerome Powell","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"jerome-powell","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:04:19.13914Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:27:18.986Z","forceShow":false,"id":"159","isCarousel":false,"label":"Fed","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:27:18.98+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"fed","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:15:05.940405Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:47:59.485621Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025","title":"How many Fed rate cuts in 2025?","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T00:34:20.302367Z","volume":31441120.049939,"volume1mo":9220726.018662002,"volume1wk":5737995.316126002,"volume1yr":31441120.049939025}
