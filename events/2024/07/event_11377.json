This market will resolve to “Trump” if Donald Trump has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Joe Biden according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 5, 2024. If Biden and Trump have equal odds, this market will resolve \"50-50\".\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election forecast, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo, specifically the numbers indicated by the blue and red trend lines for this market's resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoints for July 5 as soon as datapoints for July 6 become available. This market may not resolve until the July 6 datapoints are available. If no datapoints for July 5 are available by July 9, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 5.\n\nPlease note the resolution refers to the odds of each candidate winning as a number out of 100 reported to the 1 digit mark (eg. \"Trump 57 times out of 100\"). The listed number of simulations out of 1,000 won by each candidate will NOT be considered.
