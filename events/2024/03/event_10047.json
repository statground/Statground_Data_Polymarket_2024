Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA successful launch is defined as the Starship taking off from its launchpad and reaching a minimum altitude of 62 miles above sea level. Any subsequent anomaly (e.g., an explosion) after the vehicle reaches 62 miles will have no bearing on the outcome. \n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be SpaceX’s official video feed of the launches (e.g. via SpaceX YouTube Channel), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-31T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-12-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"5+","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-five-or-more-spacex-starship-launches-successfully-reach-outer-space-in-2024-2d547bd6-16bf-4fa7-abc6-3e0268fb8d3c.png","id":"500193","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-five-or-more-spacex-starship-launches-successfully-reach-outer-space-in-2024-2d547bd6-16bf-4fa7-abc6-3e0268fb8d3c.png","lastTradePrice":0.001,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xdf7c8fe3a983dfc52969e9b811a0896d697dd81b4217d1912c28c1e9ef5f5e00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xf3b8c974e5a5cb14c8022c39c72f4e773588224f225c36705aeee2b579820d69","new":true,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.001,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will five or more SpaceX Starship launches successfully reach outer space in 2024?","questionID":"0xdf7c8fe3a983dfc52969e9b811a0896d697dd81b4217d1912c28c1e9ef5f5e04","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"will-five-or-more-spacex-starship-launches-successfully-reach-outer-space-in-2024","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-03-20T22:17:26.233Z","startDateIso":"2024-03-20","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2025-01-01T12:32:07Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2025-01-01T12:34:51.253109Z","volume":"286410.217119","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":286410.217119,"volumeNum":286410.217119}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xdf7c8fe3a983dfc52969e9b811a0896d697dd81b4217d1912c28c1e9ef5f5e00","new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"how-many-spacex-starship-launches-reach-space-in-2024","startDate":"2024-03-20T22:19:43.869223Z","tags":[{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:16:20.826Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"74","label":"Science","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:16:20.623+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"science","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:21:32.707323Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:48:11.78Z","forceShow":false,"id":"282","label":"Elon Musk","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:48:11.771+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"elon-musk","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:39:01.850026Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:02:59.284Z","id":"6","label":"musk","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:02:59.27+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"musk","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:43:54.502806Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T22:07:23.505Z","id":"374","label":"outer space","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 22:07:23.488+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"outer-space","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:50:33.972775Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-14T15:47:25.891Z","id":"500","label":"space travel","publishedAt":"2023-11-14 15:47:25.876+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"space-travel","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:18:47.115749Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:15:23.316Z","forceShow":false,"id":"63","label":"SpaceX","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:15:23.311+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"spacex","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:37.273597Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-02-14T20:38:45.417Z","forceShow":false,"id":"1325","isCarousel":false,"label":"Space","publishedAt":"2024-02-14 20:38:45.407+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"space","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T07:00:02.650396Z"}],"ticker":"how-many-spacex-starship-launches-reach-space-in-2024","title":"How many SpaceX Starship launches reach space in 2024?","updatedAt":"2025-01-02T07:43:11.377964Z","volume":762261.201461,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
