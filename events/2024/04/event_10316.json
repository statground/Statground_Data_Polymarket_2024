Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAn anomaly of greater than 1.31°C for April 2024 is necessary and sufficient to resolve this market to \"Yes\" immediately once the data becomes available regardless of whether the figure for April 2024 is later revised.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the figure found in the table titled \"GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index in 0.01 degrees Celsius\" under the column \"Apr\" in the row \"2024\" (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt). If NASA's \"Global Temperature Index\" is rendered permanently unavailable, other information from NASA may be used. If no information for April 2024 is provided by NASA by June 1, 2024, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve \"No.\"","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-05-01T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"5","groupItemTitle":">1.31","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tree+on+fire.png","id":"500883","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tree+on+fire.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xbde1646e70e8760c99c153767b43a9b5e85013c12f90dbdd1eaada97e0dd7a00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xe22d5b0cdccf4d547c722945295ae4cb373fc9cd63cb717da41e4d6517900cbc","new":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will April 2024 show an increase of greater than 1.31°C?","questionID":"0xbde1646e70e8760c99c153767b43a9b5e85013c12f90dbdd1eaada97e0dd7a04","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"will-april-2024-show-an-increase-of-greater-than-1pt31c","spread":1,"startDate":"2024-04-11T00:18:27.366Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-05-10 18:25:34+00","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-05-11T15:13:59.62743Z","volume":"97500.567336","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":97500.567336,"volumeNum":97500.57}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xbde1646e70e8760c99c153767b43a9b5e85013c12f90dbdd1eaada97e0dd7a00","new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":false,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"how-hot-will-april-2024-be","startDate":"2024-04-11T00:19:53.021783Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:16:20.826Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"74","label":"Science","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:16:20.623+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"science","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:21:32.707323Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:17:34.814Z","forceShow":false,"id":"84","label":"Weather","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:17:34.81+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"weather","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:05:24.021765Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-01-03T17:38:30.099Z","forceShow":false,"id":"832","label":"Global Temp","publishedAt":"2024-01-03 17:38:30.089+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"global-temp","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:38:56.040231Z"},{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"how-hot-will-april-2024-be","title":"April 2024 Temperature Increase (ºC)","updatedAt":"2024-05-10T19:24:03.58565Z","volume":334852.549632,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
