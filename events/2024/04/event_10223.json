This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called winners of the House, Senate, and Presidency in the 2024 US general election. If all three sources do not achieve consensus in calling the relevant races for this market, it will resolve based on the official certification.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-11-05","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"8","groupItemTitle":"Other","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/balance-of-power-2024-election-r-Fp-y4ONJBS.jpg","id":"500640","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/balance-of-power-2024-election-r-Fp-y4ONJBS.jpg","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xebbf621279b1c7c8b341cf058d3e58bcb97a0686d836e58da792ffc7edec5c00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x642bbae73830d026ffe16ccf5543045dcc2c651432299e3dcda7cf693eb743b2","new":true,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"2024 Balance of Power: Other","questionID":"0xebbf621279b1c7c8b341cf058d3e58bcb97a0686d836e58da792ffc7edec5c08","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"2024-balance-of-power-other","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-04-24T19:25:04.621Z","startDateIso":"2024-04-24","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-11-14T06:59:54Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-11-15T06:28:57.458111Z","volume":"24501103.382891","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":24501103.382891,"volumeNum":24501103.382891}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xebbf621279b1c7c8b341cf058d3e58bcb97a0686d836e58da792ffc7edec5c00","new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"balance-of-power-2024-election","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2024-04-24T19:26:04.70075Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T22:07:37.832Z","id":"375","label":"u.s. election","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 22:07:37.815+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"uptspt-election","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:30:22.704869Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:24:23.994313Z","updatedBy":13},{"createdAt":"2023-12-27T01:23:46.901Z","forceShow":false,"id":"789","label":"US Politics","publishedAt":"2023-12-27 01:23:46.877+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"us-politics","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:09:54.893773Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-27T16:52:57.915Z","forceShow":false,"id":"573","label":"american politics","publishedAt":"2023-11-27 16:52:57.894+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"american-politics","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:48:43.97325Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:32:11.214Z","forceShow":false,"id":"188","label":"U.S. Politics","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:32:11.207+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"uptspt-politics","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:06:51.550177Z"},{"forceShow":false,"id":"100215","label":"All","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"all","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:27:54.040735Z"}],"ticker":"balance-of-power-2024-election","title":"Balance of Power: 2024 Election","updatedAt":"2024-11-15T06:49:01.841112Z","volume":80130774.416922,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
