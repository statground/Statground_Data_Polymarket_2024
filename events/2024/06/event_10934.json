Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThis market pertains to the fourth Starship launch. If the rocket lifts off the pad, it will be considered the fourth Starship launch, and this market will resolve based on it. If the rocket does not lift off the pad, it will not be considered the fourth launch, and this market will stay open until the fourth launch has occurred. If the fourth launch has not occurred by December 31, 2024, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nIf it is unclear and/or cannot be determined whether the Starship experienced RUD before or after re-entry, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from SpaceX or Elon Musk however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.
