The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if following the Federal Reserve's January 2025 meeting the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is increased by 1 or more basis points above the level it was prior to the meeting. Otherwise, it will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for January 30 - 31, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their January meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2025-01-29T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2025-01-31","featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"4","groupItemTitle":"25+ bps increase","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jerome+powell+glasses1.png","id":"512325","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jerome+powell+glasses1.png","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x9c03abba2c2f2ee09d4af02feaa5d6e1a55f6a5505e5ebfbafd7181a29cc1700","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xf497c9ea1a49a4fb69793ac89fde01f6bd5013c5b44983d35073e90840d848ce","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.001,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after January 2025 meeting?","questionID":"0x9c03abba2c2f2ee09d4af02feaa5d6e1a55f6a5505e5ebfbafd7181a29cc1704","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":50,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"fed-increases-interest-rates-by-25-bps-after-january-2025-meeting","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-11-07T22:43:25.14Z","startDateIso":"2024-11-07","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2025-01-29T22:53:00Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2025-01-30T22:29:09.730471Z","volume":"56978076.059909","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":56978076.059909,"volumeNum":56978076.059909}],"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x9c03abba2c2f2ee09d4af02feaa5d6e1a55f6a5505e5ebfbafd7181a29cc1700","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"series":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":false,"commentCount":6726,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":"0","createdAt":"2023-02-03T22:02:38.864Z","createdBy":"15","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jerome+powel+stern.png","id":"35","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jerome+powel+stern.png","layout":"default","liquidity":9502218.41908,"new":false,"publishedAt":"2023-03-22 19:17:35.835+00","recurrence":"monthly","requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"seriesType":"single","slug":"fomc","startDate":"2021-01-01T17:00:00Z","ticker":"fomc","title":"FOMC","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:05:10.942683Z","updatedBy":"15","volume":154355695.664772,"volume24hr":0}],"seriesSlug":"fed-interest-rates","showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"fed-interest-rates-january-2025","sortBy":"descending","startDate":"2024-11-07T22:45:02.085685Z","startTime":"2025-01-29T19:00:00Z","tags":[{"createdAt":"2024-11-13T01:35:38.806948Z","forceShow":false,"id":"101248","label":"Macro Fed","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"macro-fed","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:56:49.550426Z"},{"forceShow":true,"id":"100196","label":"Fed Rates","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"fed-rates","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:37:37.235297Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-11-02T21:22:21.62Z","forceShow":false,"id":"120","isCarousel":false,"label":"Finance","publishedAt":"2023-11-02 21:22:21.615+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"finance","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:19:11.002019Z"},{"createdAt":"2024-08-05T05:34:54.235643Z","forceShow":false,"id":"100328","label":"Economy","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"economy","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:47:59.485621Z"},{"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","forceHide":true,"forceShow":false,"id":"2","label":"Politics","publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","requiresTranslation":false,"slug":"politics","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T02:24:23.994313Z","updatedBy":13}],"ticker":"fed-interest-rates-january-2025","title":"Fed decision in January?","updatedAt":"2025-01-30T23:03:11.098775Z","volume":190915049.199301,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}
