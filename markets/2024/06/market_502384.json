Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than 0.0 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from May to June 2024 and “No“ otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS June 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on July 11, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.1%, the market will resolve to “Yes”, if it is 0.0%, this market will resolve to “No”).","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-11T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-07-11","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-07-11T14:35:47Z","commentCount":1,"createdAt":"2024-06-12T18:03:08.620886Z","creationDate":"2024-06-12T23:41:16.972255Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-11T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","id":"11073","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"us-inflation-0pt0-from-may-to-june-2024","startDate":"2024-06-12T23:41:16.972258Z","ticker":"us-inflation-0pt0-from-may-to-june-2024","title":"US inflation >0.0% from May to June 2024?","updatedAt":"2024-07-12T12:32:53.276573Z","volume":18652.461729,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","id":"502384","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Repetitive-markets/Inflation.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"US inflation >0.0% from May to June 2024?","questionID":"0xcc5b45f2623fb2166f7b9108f3d215640b445e91181f849eb50424626e25a5c1","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"us-inflation-0pt0-from-may-to-june-2024","spread":0.01,"submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-07-11T14:35:47Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-07-12T12:32:49.643355Z","volume":"18652.461729","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":18652.461729,"volumeNum":18652.46}
