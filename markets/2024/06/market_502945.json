Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nBiden will be considered to have gotten a name wrong if he addresses or refers to an individual using a name that is not their correct or commonly known name. This includes, but is not limited to, using a wrong first or last name, a nickname which is not associated with the person, or any mispronunciation that significantly alters the intended name (e.g. when Biden referred to Rishi Sunak as ‘Mr. Sanook’ this would qualify for a “Yes” see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm9IjiwJxAo).\n\nIf Biden says a person's name correctly but associates it with incorrect events or a different identity, this will also be sufficient to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (e.g. Biden says Andrew Tate is the current President of France).\n\nIf Biden corrects himself after using an incorrect name, it will still qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. However, if Biden begins correcting the name before he has completed saying the incorrect name, and completes a full pronunciation correctly, it will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf the debate is canceled or rescheduled to a date later than June 27, 2024 ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video footage of the debate.\n","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-06-27T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-06-27","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-06-28T08:02:31Z","commentCount":2,"createdAt":"2024-06-27T16:30:49.957791Z","creationDate":"2024-06-27T19:41:08.914921Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-06-27T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden+scratch+head.png","id":"11289","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden+scratch+head.png","negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"will-biden-get-a-name-wrong-during-the-debate","startDate":"2024-06-27T19:41:08.914922Z","ticker":"will-biden-get-a-name-wrong-during-the-debate","title":"Will Biden get a name wrong during the debate?","updatedAt":"2024-06-29T07:51:03.744295Z","volume":16043.861528,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden+scratch+head.png","id":"502945","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden+scratch+head.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Biden get a name wrong during the debate?","questionID":"0x687d8e0ba0ddd28cfc699b80f7f3dfbf8fda2ceaf1596656efffc342d9b5f426","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":30,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"will-biden-get-a-name-wrong-during-the-debate","spread":0.3,"startDate":"2024-06-27T20:27:22.595Z","startDateIso":"2024-06-27","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-06-28T08:02:31Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-06-29T07:51:02.810848Z","volume":"16043.861528","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":16043.861528,"volumeNum":16043.86}
