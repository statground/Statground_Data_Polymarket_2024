If National Rally does not enter into a coalition prior to the second round of voting, this market will resolve solely based off the number of seats won by the National Rally party. \n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the French Government, however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-07T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-07-07","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-07-08T06:28:27Z","commentCount":1,"createdAt":"2024-06-11T18:12:04.115232Z","creationDate":"2024-06-11T19:26:19.677461Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-07T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-national-rally-win-the-most-seats-in-the-national-aseembly-KNB2dt4rQ7aV.png","id":"11043","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-national-rally-win-the-most-seats-in-the-national-aseembly-KNB2dt4rQ7aV.png","negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"national-rally-coalition-wins-a-majority-of-seats-in-french-election","startDate":"2024-06-11T19:26:19.677464Z","ticker":"national-rally-coalition-wins-a-majority-of-seats-in-french-election","title":"National Rally coalition wins majority of seats in French Election?","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T02:35:47.197031Z","volume":85142.322162,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-national-rally-win-the-most-seats-in-the-national-aseembly-KNB2dt4rQ7aV.png","id":"502318","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-national-rally-win-the-most-seats-in-the-national-aseembly-KNB2dt4rQ7aV.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"National Rally coalition wins majority of seats in French Election?","questionID":"0x3e9f4f18e548192175ba805a2ffcf44888049a4eba37c2c96cc69c635b1c19c7","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"national-rally-coalition-wins-a-majority-of-seats-in-french-election","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-06-11T20:11:19.601Z","startDateIso":"2024-06-11","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-07-08T06:28:27Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-07-09T02:35:45.528916Z","volume":"85142.322162","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":85142.322162,"volumeNum":85142.32}
