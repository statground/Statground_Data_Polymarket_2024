Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election polls aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/, specifically the number indicated by the blue trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoints for June 27 and July 4 as soon as a datapoint for July 5 becomes available. This market may not resolve until the July 5 datapoint is available. If no datapoint for July 4 is available by July 7, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 4.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-07-05","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-07-06T11:23:42Z","commentCount":0,"createdAt":"2024-06-27T16:19:26.253605Z","creationDate":"2024-06-27T17:01:10.720425Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-05T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden-approval-higher-1-week-after-debate-rLPSqB8MKKnN.png","id":"11288","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden-approval-higher-1-week-after-debate-rLPSqB8MKKnN.png","negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"biden-polling-higher-1-week-after-debate","startDate":"2024-06-27T17:01:10.720425Z","ticker":"biden-polling-higher-1-week-after-debate","title":"Biden polling higher 1 week after debate?","updatedAt":"2024-07-07T11:25:51.007065Z","volume":15603.286365,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden-approval-higher-1-week-after-debate-rLPSqB8MKKnN.png","id":"502943","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/biden-approval-higher-1-week-after-debate-rLPSqB8MKKnN.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Biden polling higher 1 week after debate?","questionID":"0x888b3799224f8d993aaae7e747b5964d51813b4d00cadae9861bf885b7c96cad","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"biden-polling-higher-1-week-after-debate","spread":0.02,"startDate":"2024-06-27T17:30:55.407Z","startDateIso":"2024-06-27","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-07-06T11:23:42Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-07-07T11:25:47.257456Z","volume":"15603.286365","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":15603.286365,"volumeNum":15603.29}
