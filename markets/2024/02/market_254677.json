Otherwise this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nListed words and phrases: “Nikki Haley/Nikki/Haley”, “Joe Biden/Joe/Biden”, “Border”, “Make America Great Again/MAGA”, “Rig”. Plural forms, possessives, and different tenses (i.e., \"rigged\" for \"rig\"), of the listed phrases will count toward the resolution of this market.\n \nIf no victory/losing speech is given by February 25, 2024 12:00 PM ET, this market group will resolve to the first listed word according to alphabetical order (i.e. Biden). If there is a tie for the most number of mentions, the market will resolve to the first word in alphabetical order (i.e. in a tie between “Biden” and “Haley”, this  market group would resolve “Yes” for “Biden”).\n\nThe resolution source is live video of the speech.
