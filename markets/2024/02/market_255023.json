Trump performs worse in the Maine Republican primary compared to all other states participating in the 2024 Super Tuesday Republican Primaries. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nTrump's worst performance will be considered as either the smallest margin of victory if Trump wins all super Tuesday primaries, or largest margin of defeat if Trump loses one or more primaries.\n\n‘Margin' is defined as the difference between the percentages of votes received by Donald J. Trump and the second-highest vote-getter. Percentages of the votes received by each of the two candidates will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates in the election.\n\nThe states participating in the Super Tuesday Republican Primaries are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia excluding American Samoa.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the announcement of the primary results from the participating state Republican parties. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-03-03T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-03-03","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-03-07T03:47:30Z","commentCount":3,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2024-02-29T16:39:14.902Z","creationDate":"2024-02-29T23:18:25.342Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"qq","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trumps-worst-state-on-super-tuesday-7696351a-d32d-4dbf-ba70-f0e19b84e2c0.png","id":"903617","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trumps-worst-state-on-super-tuesday-7696351a-d32d-4dbf-ba70-f0e19b84e2c0.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskFeeBips":0,"negRiskMarketID":"0x8eac757efffaf1f5f0b239f77f779de43a166e75539be5e71c0da7ca43c09d00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2024-02-29 16:39:14.879+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"trumps-worst-state-on-super-tuesday","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2024-02-29T23:10:00Z","ticker":"trumps-worst-state-on-super-tuesday","title":"Trump's worst state on Super Tuesday?","updatedAt":"2024-04-26T03:34:07.404682Z","updatedBy":"15","volume":560210.47,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"10","groupItemTitle":"Maine","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"","id":"255023","image":"","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"18459.05053","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":18459.05,"makerBaseFee":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","marketType":"normal","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x8eac757efffaf1f5f0b239f77f779de43a166e75539be5e71c0da7ca43c09d00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x4d86245badff50ceecfd46e4d1747b8f5561d6f63cef7c8a64debf34550566bb","new":false,"notificationsEnabled":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Maine be Trump's worst state on Super Tuesday?","questionID":"0x8eac757efffaf1f5f0b239f77f779de43a166e75539be5e71c0da7ca43c09d05","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"slug":"will-maine-be-trumps-worst-state-on-super-tuesday","spread":1,"startDate":"2024-02-29T23:11:00Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","takerBaseFee":0,"umaBond":"500.0","umaResolutionStatus":"proposed","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5.0","updatedAt":"2024-03-07T03:49:35.271Z","volume":"20733.096999999998","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":20733.1,"volumeNum":20733.1,"wideFormat":false}
