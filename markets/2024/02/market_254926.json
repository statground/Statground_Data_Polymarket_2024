Trump in the 2024 Super Tuesday Republican Primaries among the states participating, excluding American Samoa. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by Donald J. Trump and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the two candidates receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates in the election.\n\nThe states participating in the Super Tuesday Republican Primaries are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the announcement of the primary results from the participating state Republican parties. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-03-03T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-03-03","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-03-09T17:01:29Z","commentCount":2,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2024-02-28T21:43:27.722Z","creationDate":"2024-02-29T00:38:37.298Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"qq","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trumps-best-state-on-super-tuesday-a29481c0-6564-4a61-b19f-238ee2a3da46.png","id":"903599","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trumps-best-state-on-super-tuesday-a29481c0-6564-4a61-b19f-238ee2a3da46.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskFeeBips":0,"negRiskMarketID":"0x91882ef46b0b986dda00c5d8369b891c82714bcc84cbbb93e4a1fad24153f200","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2024-02-28 21:43:27.688+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"super-tuesday-state-with-highest-trump-margin-of-victory","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2024-02-29T00:30:00Z","ticker":"super-tuesday-state-with-highest-trump-margin-of-victory","title":"Trump's best state on Super Tuesday?","updatedAt":"2024-04-25T21:18:58.980383Z","volume":438117.94,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"5","groupItemTitle":"Tennessee","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-tennessee-have-highest-margin-of-victory-for-trump-in-super-tuesday-republican-primaries-13f836f6-3b79-4184-8c80-8cf5fca142a4.png","id":"254926","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-tennessee-have-highest-margin-of-victory-for-trump-in-super-tuesday-republican-primaries-13f836f6-3b79-4184-8c80-8cf5fca142a4.png","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"18419.646950000002","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":18419.65,"makerBaseFee":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","marketType":"normal","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x91882ef46b0b986dda00c5d8369b891c82714bcc84cbbb93e4a1fad24153f200","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xd4dfcb60261e5561c08191d9d43d88b02d34b2415b7a5cb39e7ee7f672878c4e","new":false,"notificationsEnabled":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Tennessee have highest margin of victory for Trump in Super Tuesday Republican Primaries?","questionID":"0x91882ef46b0b986dda00c5d8369b891c82714bcc84cbbb93e4a1fad24153f20a","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"slug":"will-tennessee-have-highest-margin-of-victory-for-trump-in-super-tuesday-republican-primaries","spread":1,"startDate":"2024-02-29T00:31:00Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","takerBaseFee":0,"umaBond":"500.0","umaResolutionStatus":"proposed","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5.0","updatedAt":"2024-04-26T02:52:52.693492Z","volume":"21906.145190000003","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":21906.15,"volumeNum":21906.15,"wideFormat":false}
