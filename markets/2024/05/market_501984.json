Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIn this case \"a majority of Republican senators\" means more sitting Republican senators have signed onto the mentioned statement than have not. At the present there are 49 Republican senators; if 24 Republican senators sign this letter, this market will not resolve to \"Yes\", however if 25 sign on, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the number of Republican senators changes within this time, a majority is still required (if three Republican senators becomes an independent so there are only 46 senate Republicans, 23 signees will not trigger a \"Yes\" resolution, but 24 will).\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be announcements made by relevant Republican senators, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-05-07T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-05-07","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-06-08T08:26:02Z","commentCount":0,"createdAt":"2024-05-31T21:07:37.38161Z","creationDate":"2024-05-31T21:16:12.844151Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-05-07T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-more-senators-sign-trump-statement-umuROTd17EvD.jpg","id":"10853","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-more-senators-sign-trump-statement-umuROTd17EvD.jpg","negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"majority-of-republican-senators-sign-rubios-trump-statement","startDate":"2024-05-31T21:16:12.844152Z","ticker":"majority-of-republican-senators-sign-rubios-trump-statement","title":"Majority of GOP Senators sign Trump statement?","updatedAt":"2024-06-09T06:21:15.540596Z","volume":21574.099255,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-more-senators-sign-trump-statement-umuROTd17EvD.jpg","id":"501984","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-more-senators-sign-trump-statement-umuROTd17EvD.jpg","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Majority of GOP Senators sign Trump statement?","questionID":"0x2df4d7266bef0e37af8eaa57db077013ee8f931d1e5eee7c667259d24b6770b8","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"majority-of-republican-senators-sign-rubios-trump-statement","spread":0.01,"startDate":"2024-06-01T00:25:51.073Z","startDateIso":"2024-06-01","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-06-08T08:26:02Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-06-09T06:21:12.737344Z","volume":"21574.099255","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":21574.099255,"volumeNum":21574.1}
