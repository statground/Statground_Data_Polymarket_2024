Otherwise, it will resolve to “No.”\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for June 11 - June 12, 2024 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their June meeting with relevant data is issued.
