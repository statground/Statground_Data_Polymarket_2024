Any changes in party affiliations by members after the official election results have been declared will not affect the outcome of this market.\n\nIn the event of a tie in the total number of seats won between the S&D and another party, the market will resolve in favor of the party whose listed abbreviation comes first alphabetically (i.e., ECR would finish ahead of EPP).
