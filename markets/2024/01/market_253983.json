It lowers the cost of posting L2 rollup data to the Ethereum mainnet via “blobs” (see https://consensys.io/blog/ethereum-evolved-dencun-upgrade-part-5-eip-4844). There has been much discussion about what the gas prices per blob will be after EIP-4844 is introduced.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the median gas price per blob is greater than 0.1 ETH one month after EIP-4844 launch. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No.”\n\nIf EIP-4844 hasn’t been launched by Dec 31, 2024 ET this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source will be on-chain data for blob prices exactly 30 days (720 hours) after EIP-4844 is launched. Specifically, 30 days after EIP-4844 is launched, the median gas price per blob during the following 7-day (168 hour) period will be calculated and used to resolve this market. This market may be updated with specific sources that will be looked at for determining resolution.\n","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-29T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-12-29","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-04-19T20:20:31.024874Z","commentCount":0,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":1,"createdAt":"2024-01-18T00:02:47.711Z","creationDate":"2024-01-19T22:25:24.258Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"awfafsdxfcv","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-04-19T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"featuredImage":"","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eip+4844.png","id":"903282","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eip+4844.png","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskFeeBips":0,"negRiskMarketID":"0x19dc12fdaa7ac25f5fb17494b690e6e45a82a25c517a2b24a5329ec048129300","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2024-01-18 00:02:47.559+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"gas-price-per-blob-1-month-after-eip-4844","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2024-01-19T22:21:00Z","ticker":"gas-price-per-blob-1-month-after-eip-4844","title":"Gas price per blob 1 month after EIP-4844?","updatedAt":"2024-05-07T23:10:20.402627Z","volume":299593.283073,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"5","groupItemTitle":">0.1 ETH","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eip+4844.png","id":"253983","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eip+4844.png","lastTradePrice":0,"makerBaseFee":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","marketType":"normal","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x19dc12fdaa7ac25f5fb17494b690e6e45a82a25c517a2b24a5329ec048129300","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x048f06871c227b1c94a6824686eead23ebbea817b474016e31722cdae471c4d2","new":false,"notificationsEnabled":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the median gas price per blob be >=0.1 ETH one month after EIP-4844?","questionID":"0x19dc12fdaa7ac25f5fb17494b690e6e45a82a25c517a2b24a5329ec048129304","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"slug":"will-the-median-gas-price-per-blob-be-0pt1-eth-one-month-after-eip-4844","spread":1,"startDate":"2024-01-19T22:22:00Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","takerBaseFee":0,"umaBond":"500.0","umaEndDate":"2024-04-19 19:35:22+00","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5.0","updatedAt":"2024-05-07T23:09:48.309322Z","volume":"35364.98","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":35364.98,"volumeNum":35364.98,"wideFormat":false}
