The upper most bracket (>60%) will resolve to Yes, the rest to No.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald J. Trump wins the 2024 Missouri Caucus by more than 60% of the popular vote (compared with the second place candidate). Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nEach candidate's percentage is determined by dividing the number of votes the candidate won by the total # of votes in the election. For example if Trump gets 65% of the vote and the second place candidate gets 29% of the vote, the margin would be 65%-29% = 36%.\n\nIf no 2024 Republican Missouri Caucus takes place, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the first announcement of the results from the Missouri Republican party, however an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting may suffice.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-02-29T00:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-02-29","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-03-03T08:03:26Z","commentCount":0,"commentsEnabled":false,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2024-03-01T19:43:04.938Z","creationDate":"2024-03-02T01:58:28.744Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"qqqq","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":false,"endDate":"2024-03-02T00:00:00Z","featured":false,"featuredImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Seal_of_Missouri.svg/1920px-Seal_of_Missouri.svg.png","icon":"","id":"903678","image":"","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskFeeBips":0,"negRiskMarketID":"0x0922a30a37b31fa72e00259a100976423892051d8c4c80c8af836f2ef37b1500","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"published_at":"2024-03-01 19:43:04.714+00","requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":false,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"trump-margin-of-victory-in-missouri-caucus","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2024-03-02T01:53:00Z","ticker":"trump-margin-of-victory-in-missouri-caucus","title":"Trump Margin of Victory in Missouri Caucus?","updatedAt":"2024-03-04T00:11:09.881Z","volume":46370.35,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume24hr":0}],"featured":false,"fee":"20000000000000000","feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":">60%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"","id":"255188","image":"","lastTradePrice":0,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"makerBaseFee":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","marketType":"normal","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x0922a30a37b31fa72e00259a100976423892051d8c4c80c8af836f2ef37b1500","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x73de1e687702ad07b2a330927245e3275eb3d2f73ae3ba229b61aaeff39a3348","new":true,"notificationsEnabled":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.01,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Trump win the Missouri Caucus by more than 60% of the vote?","questionID":"0x0922a30a37b31fa72e00259a100976423892051d8c4c80c8af836f2ef37b1500","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":0,"rewardsMinSize":0,"rfqEnabled":false,"secondsDelay":0,"slug":"will-trump-win-the-missouri-caucus-by-more-than-60-of-the-vote","spread":1,"startDate":"2024-03-02T01:53:00Z","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","takerBaseFee":0,"umaBond":"500.0","umaResolutionStatus":"proposed","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5.0","updatedAt":"2024-03-04T00:10:13.992Z","volume":"450.07653600000003","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volume24hr":0,"volume24hrAmm":0,"volume24hrClob":0,"volumeAmm":0,"volumeClob":450.08,"volumeNum":450.08,"wideFormat":false}
