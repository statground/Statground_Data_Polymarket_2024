Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the first place candidate and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in a state for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nThe respective percentages of the vote won will be determined based on the official vote count once each listed state has certified their votes. \n\nIf there is a recount in any listed state before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-11-05","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-12-18T01:02:44Z","commentCount":53,"createdAt":"2024-10-08T06:16:06.755789Z","creationDate":"2024-10-08T21:44:51.27662Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on which state will have the closest results in the upcoming Presidential election.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/closest-state-in-the-presidential-election-rsW8kmLVndes.jpg","id":"13273","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/closest-state-in-the-presidential-election-rsW8kmLVndes.jpg","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x23a7adb2176b9e0b4df707abb1663c6b31e6abb9524c83828e6bf870f130af00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"closest-state-in-the-presidential-election","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2024-10-08T21:44:51.276627Z","ticker":"closest-state-in-the-presidential-election","title":"Closest state in the Presidential election?","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T21:39:32.659441Z","volume":93910262.549968,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"11","groupItemTitle":"Other","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-another-state-be-the-closest-state-bCIetHsAZyNu.png","id":"509314","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-another-state-be-the-closest-state-bCIetHsAZyNu.png","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x23a7adb2176b9e0b4df707abb1663c6b31e6abb9524c83828e6bf870f130af00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x95ffe0a9128dd24152f94e75db7cc9c4ddd9ef3bfb8db741c2167e42d3997cd9","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.0025,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will another state be the closest state?","questionID":"0x23a7adb2176b9e0b4df707abb1663c6b31e6abb9524c83828e6bf870f130af0b","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-another-state-be-the-closest-state","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-10-08T21:43:06.009Z","startDateIso":"2024-10-08","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-12-18T01:02:44Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T21:39:25.962785Z","volume":"2811052.004259","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":2811052.004259,"volumeNum":2811052.004259}
