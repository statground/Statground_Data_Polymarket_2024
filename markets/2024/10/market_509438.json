Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes for Donald Trump and for the second place candidate by the sum of all votes cast in this state for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nThe respective percentages of the vote won will be determined based on the official vote count once each listed state has certified their votes.\n\nIf there is a recount in any listed state before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-11-05","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-12-18T02:07:48Z","commentCount":3,"createdAt":"2024-10-09T19:13:06.905572Z","creationDate":"2024-10-09T21:28:56.455304Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on predicting which state Donald Trump will win by the largest margin in the upcoming election.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-state-will-trump-win-by-the-largest-margin-e3t6Wpb_ojRV.jpg","id":"13302","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/which-state-will-trump-win-by-the-largest-margin-e3t6Wpb_ojRV.jpg","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x6f96e9ecf27912b21960832f62340d29ceb922626d3cdcec2164db2210ae1b00","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"slug":"which-state-will-trump-win-by-the-largest-margin","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2024-10-09T21:28:56.45531Z","ticker":"which-state-will-trump-win-by-the-largest-margin","title":"Which state will Trump win by the largest margin?","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T16:49:30.43035Z","volume":228228.966522,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"1","groupItemTitle":"Wyoming","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-wyoming-win-idaho-by-the-largest-margin-IiN3yVgH-vly.png","id":"509438","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-wyoming-win-idaho-by-the-largest-margin-IiN3yVgH-vly.png","lastTradePrice":0.996,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x6f96e9ecf27912b21960832f62340d29ceb922626d3cdcec2164db2210ae1b00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xfe1f1f180392a066dd01509a183a65b5bbca255c2411d699cc73a41ccd99decd","new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":0.002,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"1\", \"0\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Trump win Wyoming by the largest margin?","questionID":"0x6f96e9ecf27912b21960832f62340d29ceb922626d3cdcec2164db2210ae1b01","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":50,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-trump-win-wyoming-by-the-largest-margin","spread":0.008,"startDate":"2024-10-09T21:24:28.535797Z","startDateIso":"2024-10-09","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-12-18T01:41:37Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T01:44:46.079295Z","volume":"120027.361235","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":120027.361235,"volumeNum":120027.361235}
