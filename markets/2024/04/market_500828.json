Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the NDA and the second-place party. Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the two parties receives by the sum of all votes cast in the election.\n\nPolitical alliances such as I.N.D.I.A will be considered parties for the purposes of this market.\n\nIf no 2024 Indian General Election takes place, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market will resolve based off the party composition of the NDA at the time of the official announcement of the election results, currently scheduled for June 4. Any subsequent changes to the NDA coalition will not be considered for this market's resolution.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the government of India, however a consensus of credible reporting will also suffice.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-06-04T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-06-04","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-06-16T05:52:33Z","commentCount":0,"createdAt":"2024-04-09T15:00:16.32081Z","creationDate":"2024-04-10T22:54:59.716625Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"asdasdf","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-06-01T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/flag+india.png","id":"10301","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/flag+india.png","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x983dea93a5e4b12bc16e6fac41bdc52d0a3a13dcd93bed0de8991880a97de400","new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"indian-election-nda-margin-of-victory","sortBy":"ascending","startDate":"2024-04-10T22:54:59.716629Z","ticker":"indian-election-nda-margin-of-victory","title":"Indian Election: NDA Margin of Victory","updatedAt":"2024-06-17T04:26:17.482726Z","volume":61842.052716,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"fpmmLive":true,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"2","groupItemTitle":"10-15%","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-the-nda-win-by-10-15-b3d170af-04d4-4583-810a-49bc4741db77.png","id":"500828","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-the-nda-win-by-10-15-b3d170af-04d4-4583-810a-49bc4741db77.png","lastTradePrice":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x983dea93a5e4b12bc16e6fac41bdc52d0a3a13dcd93bed0de8991880a97de400","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x64ff2ff5cb74cb71215025537dc9c5d5bf8423d4298d8d3a985a812055d51f3d","new":true,"oneDayPriceChange":0,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will the NDA win by 10%-15%?","questionID":"0x983dea93a5e4b12bc16e6fac41bdc52d0a3a13dcd93bed0de8991880a97de403","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"will-the-nda-win-by-10-15","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-04-10T22:46:29.568Z","startDateIso":"2024-04-10","submitted_by":"","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-06-16T05:42:27Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-06-17T02:26:16.48189Z","volume":"3421.407985","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":3421.407985,"volumeNum":3421.41}
