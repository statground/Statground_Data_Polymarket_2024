Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the Ruben Gallego and the second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each party will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in the 2024 Arizona US Senate election.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once Arizona has certified the vote for this race.\n\nIf a recount is initiated before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-17T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-12-17","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-11-26T18:21:03Z","commentCount":87,"createdAt":"2024-11-08T20:16:11.44301Z","creationDate":"2024-11-08T21:26:55.442328Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on the margin of victory in the upcoming Arizona Senate election.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-12-17T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/arizona-senate-election-margin-of-victory-e8Bnh-vK5s10.jpg","id":"14258","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/arizona-senate-election-margin-of-victory-e8Bnh-vK5s10.jpg","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0xba0ef2255f1d335876774382d93286861310ab83bfebc5826ecd08803dabc900","new":false,"openInterest":0,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"arizona-senate-election-margin-of-victory","startDate":"2024-11-08T21:26:55.44233Z","ticker":"arizona-senate-election-margin-of-victory","title":"Arizona Senate Election Margin of Victory","updatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:22:18.055309Z","volume":9130584.981733,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"2","groupItemTitle":"Gallego by 1-2% ","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ruben+gallego.png","id":"512455","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ruben+gallego.png","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0xba0ef2255f1d335876774382d93286861310ab83bfebc5826ecd08803dabc900","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0xd754694c2c6be2f2ae43ca65b4ba96c3c29527958815778f2cbcc439fcdb7e03","new":false,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Gallego win Arizona Senate election by 1-2%?","questionID":"0xba0ef2255f1d335876774382d93286861310ab83bfebc5826ecd08803dabc902","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":20,"rfqEnabled":false,"seriesColor":"","showGmpOutcome":false,"showGmpSeries":false,"slug":"will-gallego-win-arizona-senate-election-by-1-2","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-11-08T21:24:00.711888Z","startDateIso":"2024-11-08","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-11-26T18:21:03Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-11-27T18:18:45.258071Z","volume":"397555.116214","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":397555.116214,"volumeNum":397555.116214}
