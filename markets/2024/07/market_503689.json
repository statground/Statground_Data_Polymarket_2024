This market will resolve to “Trump” if Donald Trump has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Joe Biden according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 26, 2024. If Biden and Trump have equal odds on that date, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election forecast, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/, specifically the numbers indicated by the blue and red trend lines for this market's resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoints for July 26 as soon as datapoints for July 27 become available. This market may not resolve until the July 27 datapoints are available. If no datapoints for July 26 are available by July 29, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 26.\n\nPlease note the resolution refers to the odds of each candidate winning as a number out of 100 reported to the 1 digit mark (eg. \"Trump 57 times out of 100\"). The listed number of simulations out of 1,000 won by each candidate will NOT be considered.\n\nIf one candidate is no longer in contention for the US Presidency, this market will resolve in favor of the remaining candidate.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-26T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-07-26","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-07-27T10:41:10Z","commentCount":2,"competitive":0,"createdAt":"2024-07-17T23:28:46.627282Z","creationDate":"2024-07-17T23:50:47.277018Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"enableNegRisk":false,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-07-26T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26-VQ2iwI0zRomX.png","id":"11572","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26-VQ2iwI0zRomX.png","liquidity":0,"liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"negRiskAugmented":false,"new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26","startDate":"2024-07-17T23:50:47.277019Z","ticker":"who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26","title":"Who will 538 project as favorite on July 26?","updatedAt":"2024-07-27T10:44:06.541971Z","volume":12309.998687,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"0","groupItemTitle":"","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26-VQ2iwI0zRomX.png","id":"503689","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26-VQ2iwI0zRomX.png","lastTradePrice":0.004,"liquidity":"0","liquidityAmm":0,"liquidityClob":0,"liquidityNum":0,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":false,"negRiskOther":false,"new":false,"oneDayPriceChange":-0.008,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Biden\", \"Trump\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Who will 538 project as favorite on July 26?","questionID":"0x4211df9f3ecebc35edc4c28245dea58fdb696c2477cda925952e8e253f2a43ea","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"who-will-538-project-as-favorite-on-july-26","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-07-18T15:07:42.967Z","startDateIso":"2024-07-18","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-07-27T10:41:10Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-07-27T10:44:06.53568Z","volume":"12309.998687","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":12309.998687,"volumeNum":12310}
