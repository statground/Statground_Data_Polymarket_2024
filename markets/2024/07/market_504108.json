Kennedy Jr., says the word(s) \"mog\", \"mogs\", \"mogged\" and/or \"mogging\" at the 2024 Nashville Bitcoin Conference. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the word will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source for this will be video evidence of a candidate saying mog.\n\nNote: It is not necessary for rasmr to be directly involved in the candidate saying mog in order to qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution.
