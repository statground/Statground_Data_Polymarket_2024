Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe tipping point jurisdiction is defined as the jurisdiction that gives the winning candidate the necessary electoral votes to reach or surpass 270 electoral votes when states are ordered by the margin of victory. The margin of victory is the difference in the percentage of votes between the top two candidates. In this ordering, the tipping point state is the one where adding its electoral votes to the cumulative total reaches or exceeds 270 for the first time. \n\nThe respective percentages of the vote won will be determined based on the official vote count once each listed jurisdiction has certified their votes. For purposes of this market, the jurisdiction is considered won by the candidate who wins the popular vote in that jurisdiction. Faithless electors shall have no effect on the outcome.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the official vote count once all the listed jurisdictions have certified their votes.\n\nIf there is a recount in any listed jurisdiction before certification, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is certified. If a recount occurs after certification, the recount will not be considered.","enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","endDateIso":"2024-11-05","events":[{"active":true,"archived":false,"automaticallyActive":true,"automaticallyResolved":true,"closed":true,"closedTime":"2024-12-18T02:22:50Z","commentCount":117,"createdAt":"2024-07-15T18:28:24.398279Z","creationDate":"2024-07-16T18:06:53.636454Z","cumulativeMarkets":false,"cyom":false,"deploying":false,"description":"This is a market on which state will be the tipping point in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.","enableNegRisk":true,"enableOrderBook":true,"endDate":"2024-11-05T12:00:00Z","featured":false,"gmpChartMode":"default","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/us-election-tipping-point-state-QaKzIk2CFwii.png","id":"11524","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/us-election-tipping-point-state-QaKzIk2CFwii.png","negRisk":true,"negRiskAugmented":false,"negRiskMarketID":"0x27a926dfb9aca1aee19f968414745b90ecbaf10c44313c639d69bda6b9b3cd00","new":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","restricted":true,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"slug":"us-election-tipping-point-state","sortBy":"price","startDate":"2024-07-16T18:06:53.63646Z","ticker":"us-election-tipping-point-state","title":"Tipping Point State in 2024 Election?","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T22:51:32.054921Z","volume":26153232.580924,"volume1mo":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1yr":0}],"featured":false,"feesEnabled":false,"funded":false,"groupItemThreshold":"6","groupItemTitle":"Minnesota","hasReviewedDates":true,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-minnesota-be-the-tipping-point-state-snJAtyIrLquo.png","id":"503511","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-minnesota-be-the-tipping-point-state-snJAtyIrLquo.png","lastTradePrice":1,"manualActivation":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x27a926dfb9aca1aee19f968414745b90ecbaf10c44313c639d69bda6b9b3cd00","negRiskOther":false,"negRiskRequestID":"0x0ae04fe7de09cf46d0f15a5a234b7d2e527df5355b4f92519df938749896c18b","new":false,"oneHourPriceChange":0,"oneMonthPriceChange":0,"oneWeekPriceChange":0,"oneYearPriceChange":0,"orderMinSize":5,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"outcomePrices":"[\"0\", \"1\"]","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"question":"Will Minnesota be the tipping point state?","questionID":"0x27a926dfb9aca1aee19f968414745b90ecbaf10c44313c639d69bda6b9b3cd05","ready":false,"requiresTranslation":false,"resolutionSource":"","resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"rewardsMinSize":100,"rfqEnabled":false,"slug":"will-minnesota-be-the-tipping-point-state","spread":0.001,"startDate":"2024-07-16T18:05:58.373Z","startDateIso":"2024-07-16","submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","umaBond":"500","umaEndDate":"2024-12-18T02:18:20Z","umaResolutionStatus":"resolved","umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","umaReward":"5","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T08:09:17.088929Z","volume":"364605.61814","volume1mo":0,"volume1moAmm":0,"volume1moClob":0,"volume1wk":0,"volume1wkAmm":0,"volume1wkClob":0,"volume1yr":0,"volume1yrAmm":0,"volume1yrClob":0,"volumeClob":364605.61814,"volumeNum":364605.61814}
